### Detail
This repository contains methylation data in methylbed format, generated using ONT Dorado's modified-base calling pipeline from Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) sequencing data. The files provide per-base methylation calls, specifically for CpG methylation (5mC), derived from long-read sequencing.


### File Format
methylbed: A tab-delimited format extending the BED specification, containing methylation call information.
Columns include:
  
  Chromosome
  
  Start
  
  End (standard BED coordinates).
  
  Modified base type (e.g., 5mC).
  
  Methylation probability or score.
  
  Read ID and strand information.
  
  Additional metadata (e.g., basecalling model version).

### Data Source
Generated by ONT Dorado's modified basecalling algorithm.
Input: Raw nanopore sequencing data (FAST5/POD5).
Output: Methylation probabilities for CpG sites.
Usage
Suitable for downstream epigenetic analysis, such as differential methylation studies or visualization in genome browsers.
Compatible with tools like bedtools, pybedtools, or custom scripts for processing.
